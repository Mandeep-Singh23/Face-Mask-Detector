# Face-Mask-Detector
Face Mask Detector using haarcascade_frontalface and mobilenet_v2

The Face Mask Detector utilizes deep learning and OpenCV to accurately detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not, enabling swift identification in real-time scenarios. This advanced model contributes to public health and safety measures by enforcing face mask compliance and preventing the spread of infectious diseases.
# Tools and Softwares required

1. [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
2. [VSCodeIDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. [GitCLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. Good GPU for training the model or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and change the runtime to GPU.
5. You also need a mask for checking if the model is working perfectly or not. xD
